# One-Line any C++ file
I created this project as a way to cope with the fact that I cannot one-line every solution to my leetcode problems using python, a language that allows complex operations through its use of useful functions/libraries and dynamic and interpreted nature.

## How to one-line your files
1. Compile oneliner.cpp to create an executable file
- g++: ```g++ oneliner.cpp -o run```
- clang++: ```clang++ oneliner.cpp -o run```
2. Import/Create file to one-line
3. Call executable file with the one-lineable file as the argument
- ```./run <filename.cpp>```
